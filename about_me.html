			<p>
				Hi I'm Jake! I'm a mathematics graduate from the university of sheffield and a software developer in training.
				Gaming and reading are some of my hobbies. I'm hoping to get a career that will be a fun challenge and let me grow as a person.
				I believe that I have a powerful combination of professional skills as coding and mathematics work well together,
				My dreams are to create something new and revolutionary in the software industry and do a mathematics PHD.</p>
