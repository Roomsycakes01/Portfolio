		<h3>Project brief</h3>
		<div class='text_box left'>
			<p>
				In this project the team was tasked with making a website that displays a
				collection of dinosaurs using PhP, and object-oriented programming. The team focused on keeping the code clean and maintainable and making the website AA accessible.
				We're required to use design patterns such as Hydrator's and View helpers, and it all had to be in OOP.
				We took on 5 stories and got them all done and nearly finished a 6th.

			<p>
				Focusing on OOP and accessibility was new for us, and I am really
				proud of the application we built. The code is well-structured
				and the website is fully accessible with semantic tags, colour
				contrast and aria tags. I worked on the View helper(Museum) built the Dinosaur Hydartor,
				and text search then I worked on the css and fixing bugs while
				other people finished up their tasks. This project gave me an appreciation for OOP and
				I really enjoy coding in this style.
