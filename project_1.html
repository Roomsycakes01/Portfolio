		<h3>Project brief</h3>
		<div class='text_box left'>
			<p>
				Our team at EyUp were tasked with building a paint app in JavaScript and I was tasked with being the scrum master for the week.
				We originally took on 4 stories, but we managed to complete 12. Each story was peer reviewed by someone in the
				team then sent for a review by our trainer, before we were allowed to merge it into the main branch.
				The final product has a brush with colour picker, eraser, background colour picker, canvas resizer, print functionality and a tool to add and move text.

				Looking back on the project I'm really proud of how much work we managed to get done in a  week,
				and I'm also proud of the job I did as scrum master. It was challenging having to juggle the roles of developer and scrum master,
				but I kept the team unblocked while also contributing a lot to the project. I personally
				worked on the brush functionality, eraser, part of the text tool, canvas resizing, print functionality, colour picker and the css behind the buttons.
