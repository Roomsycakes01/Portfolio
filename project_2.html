			<p>
				This was the first legacy project we worked on at EyUp,and it was made in React.
				The task was to work on the iO Academy aptitude test that had been built over the years by previous students.
				Our team was tasked with making the admin table to display students results that fetches data from an API, adding an expandable accordion
				to it using bootstrap, adding a filter to it and finally adding an expandable modal for each entry on the table.

			<p>
				This week was especially challenging as due to illness and people waiting for
				COVID-19 test results we only had 3 people out of 7 on the team. We took on 4 stories and still managed
				to get them all done by the end of the week. I'm really proud of this achievement as we had
				only just learned how to use React, and although we got blocked a lot we still managed to submit some very nice
				clean code and get the project in before the deadline.
